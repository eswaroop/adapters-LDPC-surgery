# adapters_ldpc_surgery
Code to construct auxiliary graphs for logical measurements in quantum LDPC codes using code deformation.

Python package contains code to construct auxiliary graphs for individual logical measurements as well as provides the SkipTree algorithm [1] to implement sparse basis change from any graph to a path graph, which represents the canonical repetition code.
